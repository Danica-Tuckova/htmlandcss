		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster</p>
		<p>The device known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood, and propelled your feet against the ground in a sort of gliding movement.</p>
		<p>It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained pathway.</p>
		<p>In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.</p>
		<p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel.</p>
		<p>The front wheels became larger and larger as makers realized that the larger the wheel, the farther you could travel with one rotation of the pedals. For that reason, you would purchase a wheel as large as your leg length would allow. This machine was the first one to be called a bicycle ("two wheel"). These bicycles enjoyed a great popularity during the 1880s among young men of means. (They cost an average worker six month's pay.)</p>
		<p>Because the rider sat so high above the center of gravity, if the front wheel was stopped by a stone or rut in the road, or the sudden emergence of a dog, the entire apparatus rotated forward on its front axle and the rider, with his legs trapped under the handlebars, was dropped unceremoniously on his head. Thus the term "taking a header" came into being.</p>
